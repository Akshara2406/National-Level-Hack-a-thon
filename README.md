The IoT is one of the emerging sectors of society. As the use of IoT has increased the data from the sensors have also increased at a higher rate and a better and best computation is required. The computation models have to be analyzed by ML algorithms. These algorithms cannot be directly understood by a viewer and he/she expects the data to be more in visualizable format. For this purpose, we have created a frontend dashboard using the Atoti library. Atoti library in python is used to provide the user interface to view data as per their wish and the analyzed data using pandas, NumPy, and other libraries facilitated in better understanding of the plots when plotted against a different model of testing. The labeling of the data is taken care of by atoti itself and separate labeling isn't necessary. The Pycaret is used for the auto-ml part. By the end of this, we see that the ML models Accuracy and other parameters can be easily visualized by the user and he can change the format of his/her needs.
